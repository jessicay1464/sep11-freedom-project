### How have I been learning my tool while building our MVP?
### How have we been finishing our MVP?

### EDP
Now, we are in Step 5, creating a prototype of the EDP, the Engineering Design Process. After we finished learning our tool, we have been starting to use what we learn to build our MVP, the minimum viable product. We build an adventure game for the mouse, that they have to prevent themselves from touching the enemy mouse or else the player would ahve to restart the game again. After building the level, we have made the mouse to collect all the sprites to

### Skills
Two skills that I have accomplished during doing and finishing our MVP (The Minimum Viable Product) are Collaboration and Debugging. First, it was "Collaboration" because it was during spring break, and me and my partner Angela had been working collaboratively and splitting up the work evenly through replit although we wern't able to see each other. When we had overcame an issue, we would have chat through messages and collaboratively solve the issue together. Therefore, this had helped me accomplished this skill of Collaboration and knwoing the importance of collaboration. This lead to "Debugging". Debugging comes up when me and my partner overcame this issue and was able to use `console.log()` to help me solve the issue. For instance, the whole time, we had our console opened, and when something doesn't work, the first thing that come to my mind would be using `console.log()` and it had helped me understand the syntax errors that I am missing when I open the console and it gave me a pathway to know where my mistake is and to solve this issue.
