# Entry 4 Building MVP
##### 3/13/23

 After last time, after doing some deep tinkering of my tool, I learned many concepts about creating sprites, loading sprites, movements, background...etc. After, I learned that many different parts of the concepts were not as challenging, but the most challenging part was that connecting the scenes together was the most challenging because, it was confusing on how the code should be connected to each other. For instance, the idea of using `go()`. I have been wondering, where can this code be applied in the whole code? Should it be inside or outside of the curly brackets? What will I see when this code is writtened here?
 <br>
 How can I start my MVP? Well, I was thinking, we can start building one scene at a time, but how? It was difficult to imagine where should this sprite be placed and where can this sprite be found or should we created one? Although, I know how the many different code works, but we don't actually have our layout on what and where should each code and sprite should be placed on the screen. UP? DOWN? LEFT? RIGHT? Well, inside of our plan, we needed a day to draw a layout of what the code should be looked like. After communicating with my partner Angela, we decided to draw our own sprite. And on a computer paper, we decided to draw out our plan and for each sheet of a scene, we decided to include different scene. This was significant because, we were able to dump out our ideas into the paper. Also, since our project idea was based on adventure, we needed to make obstacles.<br>

I am now in the middle of the process of <b>Researching the problem</b><b>Plan the most promising solution</b>, <b>Create a prototype</b>. First of all, I say I was still researching the problem because I was creating the prototype, my MVP, I was still looking up the issues that I was having in [Kaboom](kaboomjs.com), reseaching the tiny issues that I had missed out accidently that can help me throughout the process of building up my code.
