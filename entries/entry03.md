# Entry 3 Tinkering with Tool
##### 02/06/23

During this part of tinkering of my tool, it was a continuation from last tinkering. I learned to `add()` sprites, `loadSprite()`sprites, `pos(x, y)` sprite, how to apply a sprite with its symbol such as `@, #, %, ^, &, * ...`. Learning these basic codes of kaboomjs, it had helped me with building scenes later on.
```js
[
	"@  ^ $$ >",
	"=========",
],
```
I learned that after using a `[]` can help us build one scene and by building what's inside it by how we convert the the s


#### Planning on learning next
The next concept that I would learn is how to build and connect the second scene together or multiple scene together. Since now, I know how to create one scene, it would be fun and interesting to create the next one. For instance, if I would want to create a scoreboard at the end of the game, it would bring the user there, but if the user loses, it would bring to the scene to "YOU LOSE" an the button for try again. Therefore, it can make the game more interactive. Furthermore, I would like to add on how I want to learn how we can connect the keys on the keyboard to control the sprites added and uploaded on the screen. As if, "How can I connect this together?" I learned most of the small pieces, so how would I connect the "little pieces" together.

### Skills
Two skills that I have learned while tinkering with my tool is collaboration and debugging. Collaboration was because when I was having difficulties with my lengthing out my project background. But I wasn't able to found out why it doesn't work after going through [kaboom](kaboomjs.com) website itself and researching in google. Therefore, I went to ask help for my partner. This was much helpful because she had also met the same issues as me before, when she was having difficulties with this issue, she went through tutorials that had helped her. So when I was having the same issue, I was able to ask for her help and she was able to collaborate with me and that helped me with debugging my issue. This leads me to debugging. I was having a tiny error with the code that made my whole output become an error. This was because I forgot a `}` after the parentheses, and this had lead me to help me use `inspect`, and this had lead me to find my error and fix it.

### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
Now, I am still on the step of "Researching the problem." This was because I am still learning my tool and how to use it. As from before, I know what my tool is, and I was able to define my problem, I am still in the process of learning on how my tool should work and learning the differnt concepts about it. Also, when coming across the code or concept that I didn't understand in the code before, I would have to research on google, or even ask for help cause in the website, we would have to come up with issues, but there isn't any explanations, but just a code and how it works, so it would be very helpful to have videos and different sources to help us with something when we don't understand it.
