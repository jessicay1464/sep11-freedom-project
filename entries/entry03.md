#### Planning on learning next
The next concept that I would learn is how to build and connect the second scene together or multiple scene together. Since now, I know how to create one scene, it would be fun and interesting to create the next one. For instance, if I would want to create a scoreboard at the end of the game, it would bring the user there, but if the user loses, it would brig to the scene to "YOU LOSE" an the button for try again. Therefore, it can make the game more interactive. Furthermore, I would like to add on how I want to learn how we can connect the keys on the keyboard to control the sprites added and uploaded on the screen. As if, "How can I connect this together?"
