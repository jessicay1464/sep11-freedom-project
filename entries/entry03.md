# Entry 3 Tinkering with Tool

#### Planning on learning next
The next concept that I would learn is how to build and connect the second scene together or multiple scene together. Since now, I know how to create one scene, it would be fun and interesting to create the next one. For instance, if I would want to create a scoreboard at the end of the game, it would bring the user there, but if the user loses, it would bring to the scene to "YOU LOSE" an the button for try again. Therefore, it can make the game more interactive. Furthermore, I would like to add on how I want to learn how we can connect the keys on the keyboard to control the sprites added and uploaded on the screen. As if, "How can I connect this together?" I learned most of the small pieces, so how would I connect the "little pieces" together.


### Skills


### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
Now, I am still on the step of "Researching the problem." This was because I am still learning my tool and how to use it. As from before, I know what my tool is, and I was able to define my problem, I am still in the process of learning on how my tool should work and learning the differnt concepts about it. Also, when coming across the code or concept that I didn't understand in the code before, I would have to research on google, or even ask for help cause in the website, we would have to come up
