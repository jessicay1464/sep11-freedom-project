# Entry 1 : Confirming my tool and topic
##### 11/07/22

Throughout my time looking through all the tools and finding the one that works best for me, I decided to use the tool <b>Kaboom</b>. At the beginning, I didn't start right away as thinking to use Kaboom as my tool throughout this project. I started using [Three](three.js). This was because the idea that I was fascinated with the 3D models that were used and created. Looking through the code and seeing that I actually want to make a game, however, [Three](three.js) is a website that would be best for designing a 3D-model. This meant that it wouldn't be as beneficial for me throughout this progress and creating a game. Therefore, I went back to the tool [list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJFrErlAZvB-0V923QGOm4X3CwiceJsKot2R6Jz8Mdc/preview), and went through the list. I found out that the one that I wanted to try out and tinker was using Kaboom. I looked up at the tutorials on how to use Kaboom. And I started tinkering with the tool using the website itself. I changed around the values for different sprites and see what it does to it and what difference that it makes to them. Going through the process and tinkering and learning, it made me confirm my tool of using Kaboom. <br>
My project idea that I want to create using Kaboom is to create an adventure game.
