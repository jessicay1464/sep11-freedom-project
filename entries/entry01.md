# Entry 1 : Confirming Tool and Topic
##### 11/07/22

Throughout my time looking through all the tools and finding the one that works best for me, I decided to use the tool <b>Kaboom</b>. At the beginning, I didn't start right away as thinking to use Kaboom as my tool throughout this project. I started using [Three](three.js). This was because the idea that I was fascinated with the 3D models that were used and created. Looking through the code and seeing that I actually want to make a game, more specifically, an "<b>Adventure Game</b>", however, [Three](three.js) is a website that would be best for designing a 3D-model. This meant that it wouldn't be as beneficial for me throughout this progress in creating an adventure game. I was to change my idea on which tool exactly that I wnat to use and at the same time, benefit me in the project the most. Therefore, I went back to the tool [list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJFrErlAZvB-0V923QGOm4X3CwiceJsKot2R6Jz8Mdc/preview), and went through the list. I found out that the one that I wanted to try out and tinker was using Kaboom. I looked up at the tutorials on how to use Kaboom. And I started tinkering with the tool using the website itself. I changed around the values for different sprites and see what it does to it and what difference that it makes to them. Going through the process and tinkering and learning, it made me confirm my tool of using Kaboom. Futhermore, I also confirmed my project idea as that I want to create an Adventure game using the tool Kaboom.<br>

I am now in the first step of the Engineering Design Process (EDP), that is the "Defining the problem." This is because we started with thinking and choosing what we are passionate about in making. This was a very complicated choice for me because this year, we can do many things with Javascript. This was very difficult for me because I would wnat to do many things and I'm very indecisive, therefore, the way that I want this to work out is that I thought of something that I would like to try and be most passionate about and it was a game, mostly and adventure game. And we started learning our tool and confirming out tool, and continuing it throughout this process of the <i>Freedom Project</i>.

Two skills that I have accomplished throughout this process is "How to Read" and "How to Learn." I chose "How to Read" because in the Kaboom website itself, there was a lot to read and keep in mind of. I was going through the website and there were tons of code and words about the webiste itself. This meant that we have to learn to read and see what makes sense to me when learning our tool. This significantly connects to the skill "How to learn". This is because after reading the documents in the actual website, we were to LOYO (Learn on Your Own). I went through the pictures, documents, examples, and tinkered (both inside and ourside the website); by using my [ide](code.cs50.io).
