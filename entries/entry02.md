# Entry 2: Learning my Tool
##### 12/12/22

Connecting back to the last blog, my tool is "[Kaboom](kaboomjs.com)".
In November 14th, I started st=etting up my tool for kaboomjs. But before that I started learning how some basic components work. I want to Kaboom's actual website to find out about the starter code and paste it into<br>
I learned my tool by watch through the YouTube tutorials and reading through the documentaries. Beoe actually tinkering, I needed to make sure that I understood each part. Therefore, I started reading through the documents and taking notes in my SEP 11 notes by doing bullet points and understanding what  the different property will work. Such as
 * `pos(x,y)` //the position of "text" and "sprites"
 * `text()` //renders text
 * `sprite()` //sprites images itself
 * `add([])` //can render both texts and sprites

#### My Goals for Winter Break
During winter break, I want to spend more time with my family and friends and also have a good break. I hope that I can use my time to catch up in any missing lessons, not only on Javascript (SEP 11) but my AP classes too.
