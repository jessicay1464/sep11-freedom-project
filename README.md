# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Jessica Yang

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about containing what we learn about Javascript throughout the year and choosing a tool and  learning it through tinkering, watching tutorials, and reading documentaries to help create a product throughout the year. It can be a game, or anything that is consist of using these ideas and tools. In addition, when we are finally done learning, we were able to use what we learn and combine them to make the product through the process of building an MVP and beyond MVP. The purpose of writing blogs is to jot down my process while doing each part of making our project. For instance, my challenges, my a-ha moments, or even some content that we learn. When going through each process of the game, we were to write a blog that is a way to help studnets process out what they are doing and what their challenges are.

## Content
For creating my project, me and my partner Angela created a game that has a theme of "Adventure" through the use of Javascript and out tool kaboom.js. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying my tool kaboom.js in order to make my adventure game, tinkering, and learning with my project, and so on. To choose our game, in this case is Kaboom.js, it had help us create a game or any product that uses most content that we learn throughout the year and using the tools that we chose to assist us making our game and product. When we are creating this game, we were to draw, add, and load the sprites, add the movements of the sprite. Also, including the pressing the arrow keys to control the movements of the sprites, to use collide and destroy to certain ingredients when we want them to disappear when the sprite touches it. Lastly, to use `go()` when the sprite passes through the door and onto the next level.

## Implications
<b>Positives</b><br>
Some positives implications are the idea of building games in a career such as 3D adventure games, cartoon animation, animation character designer, game background designer, and many more. Also, individually, people can use games as a way of earning money and that they can have their career in games and major in playing games. At the same time, games can be a way to make your brain more active and to constantly move. In the century that we are now in, the 21st century, many peiple around the world are playing games, and this can help businesses' economies increase drastically. Also, in the social world, games are avaliable to be used as communiaction wiith one anotehr to build the relationship between people and make friends online. Lastly, government and laws help regulate the game productiona dn frameworks and that they are able to reserve the rights of making the game under the first amendment.<br>
<b>Negative</b><br>
As the job rate increases, there is also a huge competition in competing over a certain job. Furthermore, as more people are more into playing games, they can get addicted to playing them and that they couldn't stop and this might affect their mental health and their personalities. In addition, as more poople are playing and applying into games due to the reason that games are getting more and more popular and more welcomed, it would lead to the other infrastructures and big systems to decrease as more and more people are applying to jobs that relate with games.
